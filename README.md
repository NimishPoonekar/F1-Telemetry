### Description

Welcome to the F1 Race Analysis Project! This Python project is designed to provide comprehensive analysis and visualization of Formula 1 race data, offering insights into various aspects such as driver performance, tire strategy, pit stop times, and the impact of weather conditions on the race.

#### Key Features:

##### 1. **Tyre Strategy Visualization:**
   Explore the tyre strategy of each driver throughout the race. The plot showcases the number of laps covered on each tyre compound, distinguishing between new and used tyres.

##### 2. **Pit Stop Analysis:**
   Gain insights into the pit stop performance of both teams and individual drivers. The project includes plots illustrating the average time spent on pit stops for each team and the total time spent in the pits for each driver.

##### 3. **Weather Data and Track Evolution:**
   Understand the influence of weather conditions on the race with detailed plots displaying track and air temperature, humidity, air pressure, wind direction, and wind speed over the course of the race.

##### 4. **Driver Performance and Position Changes:**
   Analyze the performance of each driver throughout the race with plots showcasing position changes over laps. Additionally, explore box-and-whisker plots for lap time distribution of each driver.

##### 5. **Fastest Sector Times:**
   Identify the top 10 drivers with the fastest average sector times for each sector (1, 2, and 3). The project provides bar plots for visualizing these sector times.

##### 6. **Track Dominance:**
   Visualize the dominance of drivers in different minisectors, highlighting the fastest driver in each minisector on the fastest lap.

##### 7. **Top Speed and Min Speed Analysis:**
   Explore the top and minimum speeds achieved by each team during the fastest lap, presented in bar plots.

##### 8. **Lap Time Evolution:**
   Track the evolution of lap times across the race for the top three drivers, providing a dynamic perspective on their performance.

#### Requirements:
- Python 3.x
- Required Python packages: `fastf1`, `matplotlib`, `seaborn`, `numpy`, `pandas`, `windrose`

#### Getting Started:
1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Install the required Python packages using the following command:
   ```bash
   pip install fastf1 matplotlib seaborn numpy pandas windrose
   ```
3. Run the main script to analyze the Formula 1 race data and generate insightful visualizations.

Feel free to explore, modify, and adapt this project to suit your needs. Happy racing analysis! üèÅ
